      <h3>WHAT exactly IS LEARNING?</h3>

      <h4>#learning is fun</h4>
      <p>Learning is the process of acquiring new or modifying existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences. The ability to learn is <abbr title="have something">possessed</abbr> by humans, animals, and some machines, and there is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plants.</p>

      <h3>WHAT DO YOU GET FROM LEARNING?</h3>
      <h4>#learning is fun</h4>
      <p>You can grow as a person, develop your knowledge base and improve yourself for the better.</p>
      <p>Learning something new gets us access to new and different <abbr title="a time or set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something.">opportunities</abbr> and the chance to try new experiences that might be the best ones you have ever tried!.Learning new things is very important for our <abbr title="confidence in one's own worth or abilities; self-respect.">self-esteem.</abbr></p>

       <h3>IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION?</h3> 
       <h4>#learning is fun</h4>       
      <p>Education gives us a knowledge of the world around us and changes it into something better. It develops in us a <abbr title="a particular attitude towards or way of regarding something; a point of view.">perspective </abbr>of looking at life. It helps us build opinions and have points of view on things in life. People debate over the subject of whether education is the only thing that gives knowledge.</p>

<div><article><h1>Shaping the future</h1></article>
<article><h4>My idea</h4></article>
<p>Shaping the future is an idea that originally comes from Faith Dawete, which is about voluntary work for graduates that are not able to find jobs. They could go to schools on career days  and teach students about career choices and if there are graduates that want  to teach the students the techniques they have learnt in varsity on how to cope with different challenges that they will meet, try to find methods for them or create an oppotunities to teach them exactly the module that could help them pass. Or it doesn't have to be directly to the students but it could be the teachers that are tought so that they could help the students from disadvataged schools in the township, or familarise them to the modules they will be expecting to be tought.</p></div>
